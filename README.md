## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge used a lot of background images. Learning how to manipulate these in the layout was the greatest lesson learned. The other components of the layout were relatively straight forward after completing some of the other challenges. However, I am finding the live site is not uploading the source files from my GitHub profile. I am working to resolve that issue so the live site reflects what I coded in VS code.

### Continued development

I am continuing to refine my process for the HTML mark up. I find some difficulty with creating the appropriate structure at times. While it was not as challenging on this project, another resource that I was using asked for a responsive layout for a single webpage. Creating the appropriate semantic mark up with classes to minimize the amount of CSS required is still a challenge for me.
